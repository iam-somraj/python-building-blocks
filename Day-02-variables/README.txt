Variables are just like a card holder and the value it holds is the card.

Variables are containers which are used to store, manipulate, and display information within a program.

#variable_name = value
Each variable has a unique name and a value that can be of different types.

To initialize a variable of type int :
#a = 3
To initialize a variable of type float :
#b = 13.2

To initialize a variable of type string :
#c = 'This is a string'
#d = "This is also a string"

To initialize a variable of type boolean :
#e = True
#f = False

Variable with nothing :
#nothing = None

 Python is capable of automatically detecting the variable type, which makes coding more efficient.
