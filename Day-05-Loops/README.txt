#For Loop
In programming sometimes it's necessary for perform the same operation multiple times. So,to avoid writing the same thing over and over again "Loops" comes handy.

#While Loop
In "While Loop" it allows us to keep iterating as long as a certain condition is met.

#Break (breaking buddy)
The break statement stops the loop instantly when it's certain condition is met.

#Continue (skipping buddy)
The continue statement stops the current iteration (condition) and continues to the upcoming iteration. 

#Range() 
The range() function generates a sequence of numbers, which is commonly used with the "For Loops" to repeat the code a specific number of times.

#Nested Loop  
It is a type of loop inside another loop(s). The inner loop(s) completes all it's iterations for each iteration of the outer loop(s).
