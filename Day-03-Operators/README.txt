Operators are used to perform the operations on values.

First we will discuss the most basic arithmetic operators, they may be familiar from past math classes.

1. Arithmetic Operators

Addtion: +
Subtraction: -
Multiplication: *
Division: /

2. Modulo Operator

Modulo: %

# "/" tells us the reminder of the division whereas "/" tells us the result of the division

Tip 1: Arithmetic Shortcuts

Python created a cool shortcut for self-arithmetic operations.

For example, instead of writing:
a = 5
a = a + 5 # a = 10 now

We can simplify it by writing +=:
a = 5
a += 5 #a = 10 now

3. Comparison Operators

Equal: ==
Not Equal: !=
Greater Than: >
Less Than: <
Greater Than or Equal: >=
Less Than or Equal: <=


4. Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine the conditional statements.

Python has three logical operators:

a. and
The "and" operator returns True if both statements are true.

b. or


c. not
