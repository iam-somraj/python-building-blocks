Declaring Functions:
A function is a sequence(s) of code that has a name. The purpose of a function is to reuse a piece of code multiple times.

Arguments:
An argument in a function is a value that you pass into the function when you call it. To add arguments to a function, we write them inside the parenthesis ()

Returns:
The return statement in a function is used to specify the value or values that the function should produce as its output.
